     _Soi's Travels

(With an introduction that parodys Gulliver's Travels)","placeholder","placeholder","6/15/2023
Soon after the conclusion of the second building competition, I was recommended by Buni to be participant to the Tavernn Survival Server, with which I shall continue several months, setting out for a voyage across the lands before the Aero wipe. I acquired","the modpack and determined to go forth. The last of these voyages on the previous wipe not proving very fortunate, I grew weary from the server, intending to wait until after Aeronautics released and the server wiped before I begin my journeys. After","expectation that things would stagnate, I accepted said invitation from Buni, master of the Tavernn. I set sail from the overgrown, glowberry-strewn colesseum, June 15, 2023, and my voyage was at first very prosperous.
It would not be proper, for some","reasons, to trouble the reader with the particulars of our adventures in the early hours. Let it suffice to inform him, that in my passage from thence to the coast, I came across ruins of temporary settlements by countless individuals of past, as well as a plethora of biomes. By","an observation, I found myself in a mystical field of purple trees and foliage, where I discovered an abundance of bee hives (1480,-530). It is here that this journal was conceived, of sugarcane, feather, leather, and ink. Following the coast, I ventured into an inlet  ","of river where I discovered a half-built raised house, constructed of mauve and blossom planks (1740,-290). Here a bed is provided, where I graciously slept in to skip the night. The morning after, I set out again following the coast Southeast, to where I discovered a ","field of barley (1870, -180), at which I refilled my rations before setting out again. As I sailed across the oceans, I pondered what purpose I had in staying within this world, as surely my progress will be wiped when the next wipe comes. However, as the sun set behind the","towering forest of redwoods on my right, I realized that this journal, this very act of wandering is what gives meaning, and I determined that I shall be the explorer, mapping out the entire realm of Tavernn and recording it within this journal, a nugget of experience to be used by future travelers."]}}
